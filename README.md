# WheresTheBeer
A beer locator for a production brewery.

I am a brewer at Kannah Creek Brewing Co. (www.kcbcgj.com) and want to imbed a beer locator into our website. This is my first gitHub post, and for now it only contains a python file with basic functionality.  I have had exposure to Peewee, Flask and Django, so my plan is to use these to expand this into a web app. As a novice to programming, I am learning almost everything as I write this program so any help/suggestions would be appreciated.

Objectives:

Allow people to find Kannah Beer within a given area code. Offer details about the location: website, address, type (bar, restaurant, liquor store),  bottle and/or tap, main line and/or specialty, and possibly if they are currently open.

Easily updatable by a brewery employee with no programming skills.

Be attractive and appealing as to reflect the positive image of the brand.
